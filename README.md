# Random I Ching Oracle

This project generates random hexagrams using the yarrow stalk method of the I Ching, an ancient Chinese oracle. The I Ching has 64 hexagrams that offer guidance for different situations. By creating a hexagram, you can explore the mysteries of the universe. ðŸ‘»

You can save your hexagrams on your machine and see them in a colorful console.
